****Action-related object pairs - fMRI dataset****

***Original paper***

Xu, Liu, Almeida and Heinke (2021) The contributions of the ventral and the dorsal visual streams to the automatic processing of action relations of familiar and unfamiliar object pairs. In review.

This dataset contains all raw and processed behavioral and fMRI data (anonymized) as well as analysis code, digital study materials, and laboratory log for the aforementioned paper.
